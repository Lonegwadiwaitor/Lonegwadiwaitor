## About

I like to develop cool stuff and I have lots of experience in doing so, mainly utilising Lua (on the ROBLOX platform) & Microsoft's C/++/# languages, however more recently, with Rust too!

Aside from that, I like to learn how stuff works! (mainly for security research reasons, but also for fun!)

I love Aviation, I spend a portion of my free time flying and gaining hours, working towards my license, I also fly virtually on VATSIM!

Oh, and uh I also love music.
